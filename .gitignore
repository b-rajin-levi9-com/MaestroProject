# App files (usually too large for git)
# OPTION 1: To commit app files to git, comment out these lines:
# apps/ios/*.app
# apps/android/*.apk

# OPTION 2: Keep files excluded and use one of these alternatives:
# - Store apps in GitHub Releases and download in workflow
# - Build apps in CI pipeline
# - Use Git LFS for large files
# - Store in external artifact storage

# For now, apps are INCLUDED in git (lines commented out)
# Uncomment the lines above to exclude them

# But keep the README files
!apps/*/README.md
